"I want to hear about a project they've worked on recently. I ask them about how the project started, how they determined it was worth time and effort, their process and their results. I also ask them about what they learned from the project. I gain a lot from answers to this questions: if they can tell a narrative, how the problem related to the bigger picture, and how they tackled the hard work of doing something."
